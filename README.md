# RayTracer

This project is a raytracer built in C++. 

It's based on the "Ray Tracing in one Weekend" book (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). It will deviate from the source material from this point onwards, however.


## Next steps

- Optimize (it's currently way to slow)

- Organize the project better

- Add a way to vizualize the output as the program is executed

- Add more Hittable types
